## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

I use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for my commit messages. This means that commit messages should follow a specific format to make it easier to understand the purpose of a change.

The format for a commit message is as follows:

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]
    
Here's an example of a commit message:

    feat(game): add high score tracking
    
    Adds a system for tracking the high score in the game. Also adds a 
    leaderboard page to display the top scores.
    
    Closes #23
    
This commit message indicates that a new feature was added to the game, specifically high score tracking. The scope of the change was the `game` module. The body provides additional information about the change. Finally, the footer includes a reference to an issue that was closed by this commit.

### Python Styleguide

I follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code. This includes guidelines for code layout, naming conventions, and commenting style.

Some key guidelines to keep in mind include:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Limit lines to 79 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Use double quotes for strings unless a string contains a double quote

Adhering to these styleguides helps maintain a consistent and readable codebase, which makes it easier for others to contribute and review code.
